                I am a Web Developer in training with a solid foundation in modern technologies and a strong interest in both front-end and full-stack development. I am currently training at Riwi, a space where I have strengthened my skills in JavaScript, responsive design, API consumption, programming best practices, and the creation of attractive, accessible, and user-centered interfaces. My learning process is marked by constant growth, driven by curiosity, discipline, and a desire to improve every day.
                I consider myself a dynamic person with a strong ability to learn quickly, adapt to new challenges, and integrate easily into agile work teams. I enjoy collaborating on projects where communication, creativity, and problem-solving are essential to building digital products that truly deliver value. I also have an analytical mindset that allows me to understand both the technical aspects and the business perspective, enabling me to develop efficient, scalable solutions aligned with company or client goals.
                My goal as a developer is to continue expanding my technical and professional skills, strengthen my command of the industry's most widely used tools, and participate in projects that generate real impact. I aspire to build software with clean, maintainable, and best-practice-oriented code, always prioritizing user experience and the quality of the final product. I am committed to continuous learning and to contributing value at every stage of the development process—from planning to implementation and improvement of digital solutions.
